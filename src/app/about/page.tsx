          Hi! My name is Sandra, and I&apos;ve spent 7 years abroad in countries
          such as Germany, Vietnam, Brazil, and Australia, working as an English
          and Spanish teacher. Currently, I&apos;m based in Barcelona, a place I
          chose for its proximity to my family in Tarragona. I love video games,
          board games, skating, cooking, watching documentaries, and painting.
          Iâ€™m highly adaptable to new places and care for them as if they were
          my home.
        </p>
